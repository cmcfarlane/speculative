Introduction: Towards a Finally Subjectless Object
---

17:  "the battles that swirl around epistemology are ultimately questions of ethics and politics."

18:  "the question of the object is not an epistemological question, not a question of how we *know* the object, but a question of what objects *are*."

18:  "What an object *is* cannot be reduced to our *access* to objects."

18:  "we must avoid, at all costs, the thesis that objects *are* what our access to objects *gives* us."

18:  "It is the thesis that the world is composed of objects, that these objects are varied and include entities as diverse as mind, language, cultural and social entities, and objects independent of humans such as galaxies, stones, quarks, tardigrades and so on."

19:  "The democracy of objects is the *ontological* thesis that all objects […] equally exist while they do not exist equally."

19:  "no object […] is the ground of all others."

20:  "within the framework of onticology […] there is only one type of being: objects. As a consequence, humans are not excluded, but are rather objects *among* the various types of objects that exist or populate the world, each with their own specific powers and capacities."

22:  "Subjects are objects *among* objects, rather than constant points of reference related to all other objects."

23:  "rather than thinking being in terms of two incommensurable worlds, nature and culture, we instead get various *collectives* of objects."

25:  "not everything is related to the human, nor […] is everything related to everything else."

26:  "the difference between humans and other objects is not a difference in kind, but a difference in degree. Put differently, all objects translate one another. Translation is not unique to how the mind relates to the world. And as a consequence of this, no object has direct access to any other object."

30:  "while substance is the very being of an object, its individuality or singularity, substances only ever manifest themselves through their qualities."

Chapter 1: Grounds for a Realist Ontology
---

38:  "For the realist […] claims about objects *really are* claims about *objects* and not objects as they are *for-us* or only in relation to us."

39:  "The question of what the world might be like apart from humans is, for the both the humanists and the anti-humanists, entirely foreclosed."

40:  "A post-humanist, realist ontology is not an *anti-human* ontology, but is rather, as we will see later on, an ontology where humans are no longer monarchs of being but are instead *among* beings, *entangled* in beings, and *implicated* in other beings."

42:  "The transcendental, by contrast [to the transcendent], refers to that which is a *condition* for some other practice, form of cognition, or activity."

43:  "transcendental questions are not *foundationalist* in character."

43:  "Bhaskar does not ask what the *mind* must be like for science to be possible, but rather what the *world* must be like for science to be possible."

60:  "What the epistemic fallacy identifies is the fallacy of reducing ontological questions to epistemological questions, or conflating questions of *how* we know with questions of what beings *are*. In short, the epistemic fallacy occurs whoever being is reduced to our *access* to being."

Chapter 2: The Paradox of Substance
---

68:  "objects *can* enter into relations […] it does not follow from this that objects *are* their relations."

68:  "objects are not *constituted* by their relations to the rest of the world."

68:  "objects are not identical to their qualities but are rather the ground of qualities."

68:  "Endo-relations constitute the internal structure of objects independent of all other objects, while exo-relations are relations that objects enter into with other objects."

69:  "Because substances have the power to produce events, I shall refer to them as *difference engines*, for the production of an event is the production of differences in the world."

69:  "Because difference engines or substances are not identical to the events or qualities they produce, while nonetheless substances, however briefly, endure, the substantial dimension of objects deserves the title of *virtual proper being*."

69:  "And because events or qualities occur only under particular conditions and in a variety of ways, I will refer to events produced by difference engines as *local manifestations*. Local manifestations are *manifestations* because they are *actualizations* that occur in the world."

69:  "local manifestations are not to be confused with manifestations *to* or *for* a subject, but are rather events that take place in the world regardless of whether or not any subjects or sentient beings exist to witness them."

69:  "qualities are something an object *does*."

69:  "insofar as substances are not identical to events or their qualities […] I refer to difference engines as *split-objects*."

70:  "the split between virtual proper being of objects or their powers and their local manifestations or qualities."

70:  "objects are always in *excess* of any of their local manifestations." Comparable (equivalent?) to Harman's "withdrawn."

73:  "Qualities reside in substances, they are predicated of substances, whereas substances are not predicated of anything."

74:  "A key feature of each and every object--in fact, a defining feature--is its autonomy."

74:  "Insofar as substances are not predicated of anything else, it follows that substances are not *in* anything else in the sense that qualities are in substances."

74:  "substances are always numerically *one*."

76:  "a substance is that which is capable of actualizing a variety of different qualities while remaining one and the same substance."

85:  "the very essence or structure of substance lies in *self-othering* and *withdrawal*. Insofar as objects or substances alienate themselves, as it were, in qualities, they are self-othering. They generate differences in the world. However, insofar as objects are never identical to their qualities, insofar as they always harbor a volcanic reserve in excess of their qualities, they perpetually withdraw from their qualities such that they never directly manifest themselves in the world."

Chapter 3: Virtual Proper Being
---

88:  "the virtual proper being of an object can only ever be *inferred* from its local manifestations in the world. By contrast, the local manifestation of an object is the manner in which a substance or virtual proper being is actualized in the world under determinate conditions."

89:  "First, we should not speak of qualities as something an object *possesses*, *has*, or *is*, but rather as *acts*, *verbs*, or something that an object *does*. Second, knowing an object does not consist in enumerating a list of essential qualities or properties *belonging* to an object, but rather consists in knowing the *powers* or *capacities* of an object."

90:  "qualities are *acts* on the part of objects precisely because qualities *vary*."

100:  "Like the trail of slime left behind in the wake of a snail or slug, the individual is merely the remainder or excrescence of a differential process of individuation that has already moved on."

104:  "an account of the virtual that treats it as a dimension of primary substance or discrete individuals, where substance precedes the virtual (transcendentally, not temporally) not the reverse, and where *actual* entities are capable of interacting with one another."

105:  "the claim that the virtual is real is the claim that virtual is always the virtuality of *a* substance or individual being."

105:  "the virtual is always the virtuality or potentiality *of a* being or substance."

105:  "the virtual is *relational*. These relations, however, are not relations *between* entities, but constitute the endo-structure of an object, its internal topology."

131:  "the hegemonic fallacy occurs whenever one type of entity is treated as the ground of *explanans* of all other entities."

Chapter 4: The Interior of Objects
---

136:  "Here 'prehension' refers to the manner in which one entity grasps or relates to another entity."

137:  "my thesis is *not* that *all* objects are *autopoietic* machines."

140:  "the operations of an autopoietic system refer only to *themselves* and are products of the system itself."

140:  "a system cannot communicate with its environment and an environment cannot communicate with a system."

141:  "autopoietic systems are closed in on themselves, that they do not relate directly to an environment, that they do not receive *information* from an environment. As a consequence, it follows that information is not something that *pre-exists* an autopoietic machine, waiting out there in the world to be found."

143:  "The point is *not* that nothing exists apart from a system […] but rather that what constitutes an element for a system does not pre-exist the system that constitutes or constructs it."

145:  "insofar as it is not possible to feasibly connect every element of the system to every other lament, it follows that systems must maintain selective relations among their elements"

146:  "relations are contingent strategies for contending the with environment"

146:  Quoting Luhmann--"systems of a higher (emergent) order can possess less complexity than systems of a lower order because they determine the unity and number of elements that compose them"

146:  "the environment is not a *container* of substances or systems that precedes the existence of substances or systems. There is no environment 'as such' existing out there in the world."

146:  "the distinction between system and environment is, as a consequence, paradoxical and *self-referential*."

148:  "Humans belong not to *society*, but rather the *environment* of society. Paradoxically, then, humans are *outside* of society."

151:  "objects relate only to themselves and never to their environment."

151:  "every substance or system is organized around a distinction between system and environment that the system itself draws."

151:  "autopoietic substances, in contract to allopoietic substances, constitute their own elements or perpetually reproduce themselves through themselves or their own activities."

151:  "substances are such that we can have substances nested within substances, while these substances nested within substances nonetheless belong to the *environment* of the substance within which they are nested."

168:  "The key point not to be missed is that the qualities of an object are *variable*. Every object, allopoietic or autopoietic, is capable of a variety of *different* local manifestations. And we can say that perhaps every object is capable of producing an infinite number of different properties."

169:  "Regimes of attraction are networks of fairly stable exo-relations among objects that tend to produce stable and repetitive local manifestations among the objects within the regime of attraction."

172:  "1) mapping the exo-relations n which particular local manifestations take place, and 2) varying the exo-relations into which an object enters to determine the variations of which it is capable."

174:  "Insofar as all objects are operationally closed, no object can transfer a force to another object without that force being transformed in some way or another."

186:  "think a subjectless object or an object that is not merely a correlate of a subject."

Chapter 5: Regimes of Attraction, Parts, and Structure
---

194:  "In its focus on the operational closure of objects, the self-regulation and self-reproduction of objects, and the manner in which objects constitute *their own* information, autopoietic theory tends towards a utopianism that ignores material constraints on the activity of objects when objects enter into exo-relations with other objects."

196:  "What we need is an account of exo-relations capable of doing justice to both the closure and withdrawal of objects as well as the constraints that other objects exercise on withdrawn objects.

196:  "while objects are only selectively open to their environments, this doesn't entail that objects are free to do whatever they might like with their environments."

200:  "environments cannot be treated as something that is simply given or there such that the organism subsequently fills a niche that already existed in the environment."

200:  "we can only discover what constitutes the environment of an organism through a second-order observation of how the organism relates to the world around them."

202:  "*distributed* causality, where a variety of different causal factors contribute to the development of the phenotype."

203:  "Continental social and political thought and theory needs to do a much better job in exploring the role played by non-semiotic actants such as natural resources, the presence or absence of power lines, road distributions and connections, whether or not cable internet connections are available, and so on, in their exploration of why certain social formations take the form they do."

205:  "Regimes of attraction should thus be thought as interactive networks or, as Timothy Morton has put it, meshes that play an affording and constraining role with respect to the local manifestations of objects."

207:  "one of the central roles of social and political theory ought to be the cartography of regimes of attraction. This cartography consists in mapping those networks of objects that play a significant role in the production of local manifestations at the level of individuals, groups, and the texture of societies at large."

207:  "we must avoid the conclusion that regimes of attraction *determine* the local manifestations of objects or entities."

216:  "what constitutes the substantiality of a substance is not the *parts* that compose it, but rather the organization, domestic relations, or endo-relations presiding over the organization of these parts."

217:  "we must avoid reducing objects to the manner in which they are enlisted by other objects precisely because the objects enlisted are always themselves autonomous objects. Another way of putting this would be to say that there is no harmony or identity of parts and wholes. Parts aren't parts for a whole and the whole isn't a whole for the parts. Rather, what we have are relations of dependency where nonetheless parts and wholes are distinct and autonomous from one another."

226:  "while we can and do indeed have relations between humans and nonhuman objects, these relations are no more privileged than relations between nonhuman objects and nonhuman objects. Moreover, insofar as nonhuman objects are themselves actors or agents, they can no longer be treated as passive screens for human and cultural projections."

228:  "In many respects, the real miracle is not that change takes place, but rather than change is not more frequent. This is especially mysterious in the case of higher-order or higher-scale systems or objects such as social systems."

232:  "each system or object must *reproduce* itself across time. In he absence of a reproduction of elements and therefore of relations, the object dissolves or falls apart."

234:  "there is the question of how events are to be constrained and selected within a system."

234:  "there must be selectivity or constraint with respect to the events that a system is open to from the world or its environment."

235:  "each system faces the question of how to produce subsequent events so as to continue its existence across time."

236:  "Because objects face the question of how to get from one moment to the next, they are condemned to change and their identity is a dynamic identity that perpetually reproduces itself across time."

238:  "selection, constraint, distinction and organization involve risk at the level of structure."

Chapter 6: The Four Theses of Flat Ontology
---

245:  "First, due to the split characteristic of all objects, flat ontology rejects any ontology of transcendence or presence that privileges one sort of entity as the origin of all others and as fully present to itself."

246:  "Second, flat ontology signifies that *the* world or *the* universe does not exist."

246:  "Third […] flat ontology refuses to privilege the subject-object, human-world relation as either a) a form of metaphysical relation different in *kind* from other relations between objects, and that b) refuses to treat the subject-object relation as implicitly included in every form of object-object relation."

246:  "Finally, fourth, flat ontology argues that all entities are on equal ontological footing and that no entity, whether artificial or natural, symbolic or physical, possesses greater ontological dignity than other objects."

249:  "First, humans are not at the centre of being, but are *among* beings. Second, objects are not a pole opposing a subject, but exist in their own right, regardless of whether any other object or human relates to them. Humans, far from constituting a category called 'subject' that is opposed to 'object', are themselves one *type* of object among many."

269:  "In the first approximation, flat ontology consists in the thesis that there are no transcendent terms, no exceptions, no positions 'out-of-field', with respect to withdrawal. Here being is flat in the precise sense that all beings are characterized by withdrawal and self-othering. In this regard, all beings that populate the multiple-composition of being are strange strangers. The consequence of this is a democracy of strange strangers."

271:  "a collective is an entanglement of human and nonhuman actors or objects."

271:  "if flat ontology is to truly be flat, then it is necessary to establish that the world is not a container within which beings are found. Alternatively, it must be shown that the world is not a super-object composed of all other objects as sub-multiples that form a harmonious whole consisting of beings as complementary and inter-locking parts."

274:  "insofar as environment is constituted by the object 'drawing' the distinction between system and environment, it cannot be said that environments are a present-at-hand milieu in which objects exist."

274:  "because objects are only selectively open to their environments, it follows that objects are not open to all systems in their environment."

279:  "it becomes clear that ontologically the bland human-world gap or relationship possesses no metaphysical priority."

279:  "a heteroverse or pluriverse, where entities at all levels of scale, whether natural or cultural, physical or artificial, material or semiotic are on equal ontological footing."

283:  "the point is to expand the domain of what can be investigated, not to limit it."
289:  "there can be no question of technological or environmental determinism precisely because objects cannot be determined by other objects."
