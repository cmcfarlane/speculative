Despite the relative lack of notes, the article is a very interesting meditation on the adequacy of, respectively, Spinoza's and Bergson's understanding of immanence to make sense of a concrete event: viz., severely wounding a lizard while cutting the grass.

208:  immanence is associated with "the temporally and spatially located."

208:  "immanence should not be confused with intentionality or (more narrowly) with humanity. To the contrary, any tight representation confounds the material meaning of immanence."

208:  "the concept of immanence (and the timing of its actual manifestations) generates demands upon humans that are of consequence exactly because they are not entirely predictable, especially with regard to their duration."

210-1:  "Anyone who 'has' a lawn knows that lawns require a substantial amount of work to create and maintain. As others have noted, maintenance of the modern lawn usually requires the frequent use of machines and chemicals and the consistent input of water. Reseeding may also be required from time to time. The work and sweat demanded by these actions diverge considerably from the quiescent image of the lawn."

211:  "Because of this, I hate my lawn."

211:  "Robbins (2007) showed that the primary reason residents maintained their lawns was to conform to the perceived social expectations of their neighbours."

212:  "the gardening activity I despise the most is mowing the lawn. I despise it because I know there are things in there, many things, which have found, for the moment, a bounty that is good."

212:  "I wait and I wait and I wait, as I know that when I am mowing the lawn, when I am enacting aesthetics, I am killing many things."
