Chapter 1: Towards a Speculative Philosophy (Levi Bryant, Nick Srnicek and Graham Harman)
---

3:  "Humanity remains at the centre of these works, and reality appears in philosophy only as the correlate of human thought. In this respect phenomenology, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, and postmodernism have all been perfect examplars of the anti-realist trend in continental philosophy."

3:  "all have certainly rejected the traditional focus on textual critique."

3:  "all of them, in one way or another, have begun speculating once more about the nature of reality independently of thought and of humanity more generally."

3:  "Speculation in this sense aims at something 'beyond' the critical and linguistic turns. As such, it recuperates the pre-critical sense of 'speculation' as a concern with the Absolute, while also taking into account the undeniable progress that is due to the labour of critique."

3:  Quoting from Meillassoux, *After Finitude*, 5. "the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other."

4:  "we can never consistently speak about a realm independent of thought or language."

4:  "This general anti-realist trend has manifested itself in continental philosophy in a number of ways, but especially through preoccupation with such issues as death and finitude, an aversion to science, a focus on language, culture, and subjectivity to the detriment of material factors, an anthropocentric stance towards nature, a relinquishing of the search for absolutes, and an acquiescence to the specific conditions of our historical throwness."

7:  "One of the key features of the Speculative Turn is precisely that the move toward realism is not a move toward the stuffy limitations of common sense, but quite often a turn toward the downright bizarre."

7:  "Brassier's work aims at eliminating anything that might falsely make us feel at home in the world. The result is a position that might be called an eliminativist nihilism that takes the destruction of meaning as a positive result of the Enlightenment project: something to be pushed to its ultimate end, despite all protests to the contrary."

12:  "Srinicek argues that it is nonetheless the case that any realist ontology must be devoid of grounds for ethical and political action."

13:  "The ontic principle [Bryant] proposes that prior even to questions of epistemology, all questions of ontology presuppose difference and, more specifically, the production of difference."

16:  "If the basic claim of realism is that a world exists independent of ourselves, this becomes impossible to reconcile with the idea that all of ontology is simultaneously political. There needs to be an aspect of ontology that is independent of its enmeshment in human concerns."

16:  "A more serious issue for the new realisms and materialisms is the question of whether they can provide any grounds or guidelines for ethical and political action."
