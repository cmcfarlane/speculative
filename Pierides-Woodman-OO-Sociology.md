Pierides, Dean and Dan Woodman. "Object-oriented sociology and organizing in the face of emergency: Bruno Latour, Graham Harman and the material turn." *The British Journal of Sociology* 63, no. 4 (2012): 662--79.

667:  An object is emergent (it is more than its parts) and at the same time it is also more than its engagements (it is also withdrawn). This double irreducibility allows objects to surprise other objects and us.

Okay. But this appears as though the authors are claiming that there is a distinction between "other objects" (=things, =nature) and "us" (=humans, =social/cultural). This precisely misses the point insofar as humans are but one type of object among all others.

668:  "the acceptance of difference between primary and secondary qualities" and "the implications this has for the relationship between emergence and reality."

669:  "Latour flattens the distinction so that all objects are equally real, if not equally strong become some objects have more 'alliances' than others."

669:  "Latour refuses that a thing can have a reality apart from its relations."

670:  "Our disciplinary starting point in this paper is a shift in the sociology of organization from the stronghold of correlationist thought to a sociology that seeks to take things seriously."

671:  turning to the account of the Victoria fire, the authors once again turn to a humanism, focusing upon the "human impact," meaning the effect that extreme heat has on humans.

672:  "The central issue is that the VBRC [Royal Commission] affords these 'natural' objects a different ontological status to 'social' objects."

672:  "By separating natural objects from social objects, the VBRC was able to focus separately on formal organizational issues."

675:  "Because objects are withdrawn, they generate surprises for other objects, hence new relations can emerge, and hence new gaps (or withdrawn objects) can also emerge."

676:  "An object-oriented sociology accounts for the object-object relations which, along with the vast networks of organizational activity, generate surprises and paves the way for organizational practices that engage with the messiness of the real, a messiness that is harder to ignore during crises."

677:  "By bringing materiality back into sociology, objects are granted a central place in sociological analysis."
