473-4:  "Even though the word 'composition' is bit too long and windy, what is nice is that it underlines that things have to be put together (Latin *componere*) while retaining their heterogeneity."

474:  "It thus draws attention away from the irrelevant difference between what is constructed and what is not constructed, toward the crucial difference between what is *well* or *badly* constructed, *well* or *badly* composed. What is to be composed may, at any point, be *de*composed."

474:  "compositionism could stand as an alternative to *critique*"

474-5:  "it 'ran out of steam' because it was predicated on the discovery of a true world of realities lying behind a veil of appearances."

475:  "Critique, in other words, has all the limits of utopia: it relies on the certainty of the world *beyond* this world. By contrast, for compositionism, there is no world of beyond. It is all about *immanence*."

475:  "*what performs a critique cannot also compose*"

475:  "Critique was meaningful only as long as it was accompanied by the sturdy yet juvenile belief in a real world beyond."

475:  "*iconoclash*--namely, the *suspension* of the critical impulse, the transformation of debunking from a *resource* ... to a *topic* to be carefully studied."

476:  "ecology seals the end of nature."

476:  "Nature is not a thing, a domain, a realm, an ontological territory. It is ... a way of organizing the division ... between appearances and reality, subjectivity and objectivity, history and immutability."

477:  "*what is the successor of nature*?"

478:  "We compositionists want immanence *and* truth together. Or, to use my language: we want *matters of concern*, not only *matters of fact*. For a compositionist, nothing is beyond dispute."

481:  "our age has become the age of wonder at the *disorders* of nature."

481:  "there is no way to devise a successor to nature, if we do no tacke the tricky question of *animism* anew."

483:  "An extraordinary feat: making, for purely anthropocentric reasons, the accusation of being anthropomorphic into a deadly weapon!
