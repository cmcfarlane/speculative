156:  "the essence of law" for Miéville is "command and prohibition."

156:  phenomenological understanding: "the appearance of the law through its embodiment, are encountered directly and are accessed through their meaning to the observer's consciousness."

157:  "the command is silent, the prohibition irreducible, and bother are enjoyably suffered."

157:  "this 'implicit' or silent content of the command."

157:  "*Jouissance* is sometimes defined as 'enjoyable suffering'; here it is not to be taken in the sense of pain, but rather in the sense of an ejection of pleasure where pain is overcome through the commitment to an act rather than the action itself."

157:  "this excessivity called *jouissance* is modulated by the structures of command and prohibition in three distinct ways: *jouis-sans, *j'ouï-sens*, and *jouis-sens*."

157: *jouis-sans* is "duty to the law ... that which is without enjoyment"

158:  *j'ouï-sens* is "the objectification that succeeds the first wherein the agent of some symbolic mandate or agent of the law sets about arranging the rituals and processes of the symbolic mandate where such a mandate is reified to embody an ideal"

158:  *jouis-sens* is "the agent of the symbolic mandate becomes the law itself."

160:  "the problem for Borlú as an agent of the law is thus when to enact his positon as an agent (of law) rather than a (human) subject, a difference that highlights the divide between the permissiveness and authoritative structures of legality itself."

162:  "In less psychoanalytic terms, we might post that Miéville's narrative reverses the 'breach of the law' into the 'Law of Breach." This reversal suggests that the proper conducts the law, Borlú's symbolic mandate as a detective for example, is not to break the law but to acknowledge that the law itself breaks and breaks up time and space."

167:  "Miéville's narrative offers an explicit criticism of a purely positivistic interpretation of law."
