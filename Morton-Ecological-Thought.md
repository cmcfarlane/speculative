Morton, Timothy. *The Ecological Thought*. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2010.

Previously read this book when it was first published and making the rounds in the blog-o-sphere. I had a rather visceral reaction to it: found it all very vague, poorly argued, and, ultimately, incoherent. Nonetheless, a lot of people found value in the book. So, after some remove, I'm looking at it again.

1:  "The ecological crisis we face is so obvious that it becomes easy--for some, strangely or frighteningly easy--to join the dots and see that everything is interconnected. This is *the ecological thought*. And the more we consider it, the more our world opens up."

This is where my problems with the book begin: in the very first chapter. "The ecological thought" = "everything is interconnected." Similarly vague formulations appear repeatedly throughout the book. For instance, the next paragraph ends as follows:

"But what would an ecological society look like? What would an ecological mind think? What kinds of art would an ecologically minded person enjoy? All these questions have one thing in common: *the ecological thought*."

Here is an example of slippage and the book is only two paragraphs long at this point. In the first case, "the ecological thought" means that "everything is connected." In the second case, "the ecological thought" refers to dispositions of those who have an "ecological mind" or those who are a part of "an ecological society." But, these are in contradiction with one another: if everything is already connected (the first version) that connection exists whether anyone is conscious of that connection or not. 

The ecological thought is the thought of interconnection and the thought that the thought of that interconnection has? This vague and borderline silly.

2:  "Is that the sound of something calling us from within the grief--the sound of the ecological thought?"

Now the ecological thought is a sound that sounds like grief. Interconnection is now trauma and obsessive compulsiveness.

2:  "The ecological thought is a virus that infects all other areas of thinking."

2:  "the ecological thought creeps over other ideas until nowhere is left untouched by its dark presence."

3: "the ecological thought rigorously comes afterward--it is always to come, somewhere in the future. In its fullest scope, it *will have been thought* at some undefined future point. You find yourself caught in its tractor beam (it's like a mathematical 'attractor'). You didn't mean to. You must have been thinking it all along. But you had no idea. The ecological thought sneaks up on you from the future, a picture of what will have had to be there, already, for 'ecology without nature' to make sense."

3:  "Ultimately the ecological thought surpasses what passes environmentalism."

3:  "the ecological thought has been there all along."

3:  "'Nature' fails to serve ecology well. I shall sometimes use a capital *N* to highlight its 'unnatural' qualities, namely (but not limited to), hierarchy, authority, harmony, purity, neutrality, and mystery."

4:  "Why call this book *The Ecological Thought*? Why not *An Ecological Thought* or *Some Ecological Thoughts*? Or more modestly, *Notes toward Ecological Thinking*? Or just *Ecological Thought*? Of there are ecological thoughts. And this book has no monopoly on ecological thinking. But there is a particular kind of thinking that I call *the* ecological thought. It runs like a strand of DNA code through thousands of other kinds of thoughts. Moreover, the *form* of the ecological thought is at least as important as its *content*. It's not simply a matter of *what* you're thinking about. It's also a matter of *how* you think. Once you start to think the ecological thought, you can't unthink it: it's a sphincter--once it's open, there's no closing."

And like the most well-known of all sphincters, once it opens, shit starts to run.

5:  "Our continued survival, and therefore the survival of the planet we're now dominating beyond all doubt, depends on our thinking past Nature."

Perhaps the major part of the sentence is true ("Our continued survival [...] depends on our thinking past Nature"), but it is not clear how the subordinate clause ("and therefore the survival of the planet") is true insofar as it depends upon (1) "our continued survival" and (2) "thinking past Nature." And, as always, a constant refrain: what does "our continued survival" matter?

6:  "While we're on the subject of Nature and 'new and improved' upgrades, this book makes a rigorous distinction between *environmentalism* and *ecology*."

I hope so.

7:  "Ecology shows us that all beings are connected. *The ecological thought* is the thinking of interconnectedness. The ecological thought is a thought about ecology, but it's also a thinking that is ecological. Thinking the ecological thought is part of an ecological project."

I'm not convinced that "connected" and "*inter*connected" refer to the same thing. More slippage. But, still, if ecology is about "(inter)connectedness" and ecology is, well, a form of thinking, how do ecology and the ecological thought differ from one another? Why read Morton's book instead of, say, a textbook on ecology?

7:  "When we start looking, we find the ecological thought everywhere. This isn't surprising, since the ecological thought is interconnectedness in the fullest and deepest sense."

Okay, but what is interconnectedness? Interconnectedness is that everything is connected. Everything is connected is the ecological thought. Equivocation and vagueness all the way.

8:  "The ecological thought insists that we're deeply connected even when we say we're not. Thinking itself is an ecological event."

8:  "The ecological view to come [...] is a vast, sprawling mesh of interconnection without a definite center or edge. It is radical intimacy, coexistence with other beings, sentient and otherwise--and how can we so clearly tell the difference?"

Tell the difference between what? Unclear. If no "definite center or edge," is there an indefinite center or edge? This can't be because the edge itself would be connected. Indeed, interconnected.
