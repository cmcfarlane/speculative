170:  Western philosophy establishes "To see is to know, and to know is to be, and conversely, to not see is not to know and therefore not to be."

170:  "the lineage between seeing, knowing, and being, is all very well except for the unfortunate detail that it by-passes truth. Moreover, this lineage, by assuming masculine notions of what it is to see, to know, and to be, also by-passes the feminine."

170:  "Lacan and Saramago suggest that women, or those sexed beings on the feminine side of the formula of sexuation, have the potential of attaining a closer relationship to the Real, that is to a truth beyond language."

170:  heroine of both is called "the Doctor's wife." Thus, not the police superintendent (=law) or the Doctor (=science), but the woman. "a truth beyond science, beyond politics, and beyond even language." Compares to Socrates's wife, Diotima.

171:  "Like love, in other words, perhaps truth is not only blind but blinding."

171:  "My suggestion will be that Lacan and Saramago explore and expose the limits of western epistemology and its version of truth in the process strip away the defensive layers we build to protect us from the blinding truth, and bring us face to face with what is normally out of view, that is, the raw Real."

171:  "If Lacan the anti-philosopher pushes the limits of philosophy, Saramago, through his fiction, pushes the limits of the possible and alerts us to the possibility of the impossible."

172:  the epidemic of blindness is the Real: "what renders it 'Real' is that it exceeds our capacity for representation; since we do not have the words to represent it, it remains unassimilable in our experiences."

173:  "For psychoanalysis, however wide our field of vision, there is one point we are never able to see, that is, the point from which we are looked at."

173:  "the subject is seen before she is able to see"

176:  "So the kernel of our being is not the bits we can see and know and speak, but precisely the bits we can neither see, nor speak, that is, the missing bits."

177:  "the allegory of an epidemic is used to highlight what is basest rather than noble in human nature and Saramago's tale is no exception."

177:  "If Saramago's people suffer from seeing 'too much,' they also, to follow the Doctor's thoughts and Enlightenment philosophers' coupling of seeing with knowledge and blindness with ignorance, they know, indeed *are*, too much."

178:  "It is also significant that those protesting the government's distortion of words are exclusively men: the Minister of Culture, the Council leader, the police superintendent. The women in the book, on the other hand, do not bother pointing out the government's semantic errors. That is because, as I suggested earlier, women's relation to truth goes beyond words, or, to put it another way, women never trusted words to begin with."

178:  "In the absence of an all-knowing God, literature becomes the refuge, or, as I describe it in another paper, the *little object a* that we hope will fill the gap that neither law nor science can provide."

179:  "My suggestion is that the traumatic experience of Saramago's blind, enables them to find the truth about themselves; Saramago's suggestion is that we can only see ourselves, the kernel of our being, when we are blind; that 'perhaps only in a world of the blind will things be what they truly are.'"

179:  "As the one person who retains her sight in a sea of blindess, the Doctor's wife occupies the position of the analyst, the subject supposed to know the patient's unconscious desires."

183:  "The new subject that emerges following the Real of blindness is death drive personified. Post the trauma of blindness, the subject is cut off from her old memories and indeed the people we encounter in *Seeing* are characterized by their collective agreement not to refer to their experience of blindness: there is, as it were, 'national pact of silence to which we all agreed.'"

185:  "Ironically while the electorate in Saramago have seen the non-existence of the Big Other, and make no demands from it, the Big Other is the one who starts to shout and demand a response from the electorate. The electorate's silence doesn't just baffle the government but threatens its very being. And instead of the electorate falling prey to some mythical conspiracy theory, it is the government that starts fearing that there must be some mythical conspiracy against it"
