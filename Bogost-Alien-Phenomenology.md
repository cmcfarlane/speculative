Bogost, Ian. *Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing*. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2012.

Epigraph is from They May Might Be Giants--an ominous start.

8:  Citing Nash & Broglio introduction to *Configurations* issue on animal studies, Bogost states: "Once more, we find a focus on creatures from the vantage point of human intersubjectivity, rather than from the weird, murky mists of the really real."

8:  "We might also question animal studies' arbitrary specificity. Why trees and sea turtles instead of minerals or stem and leaf succulents? As Steven Shaviro has said in a passing criticism of the zoocentrism animal studies exhibits, 'What about plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, etc.?"

The answer to this seems rather obvious. Animal studies names "animals" as its object of studies. The word "studies" generally refers to something like the "sociology of [x] and humans." The criticism is odd: do they also criticize theoretical astrophysicists for not including lasagna in their analyses of black holes? This is stupid. Furthermore, I doubt anyone "in" animal studies would have many serious objections to studying, as Shaviro puts it, "plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, etc." Indeed, there are people who do so--i.e., "plant studies."

10:  "for the computer to operate at all *for us* first requires a wealth of interactions to take place *for itself*."

10:  vitalist/panpsychist approaches: "draws far too much attention to the similarities between humans and objects, rather than their differences."

11:  "In short, *all things equally exist, yet they do not exist equally*. The funeral pyre is not the same as the aardvark; the porcelleta shell is not equivalent to the rugby ball. Not only is neither pair reducible to human encounter, but also neither is reducible to the other."

It isn't clear how these two examples demonstrate the maxim. Part of the reason is that Bogost appears to be equivocating. In the first half of the maxim, "equally exist" refers to whether a thing exists or not. Hence, if it exists, then it exists. Full stop. In the second half of the maxim, the words "equally" and "exist" have taken on a new meaning. "Equal" is now taken to mean "in the same way." It is a moderately clever turn of phrase, but it is confused. Fortunately, in the next paragraph, Bogost comments "This maxim may seem like a tautology--or just a gag." If so, it's a bad one.

12:  A reiteration is more helpful: "things can *be* many and various, specific and concrete, while their *being* remains identical."

12-3:  "I've given the name *system operations* to the top-down organizing principles symbolized by ideas like 'the world' in Bryant's sense. System operations are 'totalizing structures that seek to explicate a phenomenon, behavior or state in its entirety.' They tend to assume that some final, holistic, definitive explanation accounts for and explains being."

Citing Ian Bogost, *Unit Operations*, 6. MIT Press, 2006.

13:  "In our current age, two such system operations are dominant: scientific naturalism and social relativism. The first descends from Democritus and Epicurus, if indirectly. The scientific naturalist holds that some fundamental material firmament sustains and thereby explains all that is. The particulars of this ground don't particularly matter--particle physics, genetics, brain chemistry, whatever. Never mind the *sort* of stuff, for the scientific naturalist there is always *some* stuff out of which all others can be explained. Furthermore, the nature of these fundamental objects and their role in founding the world can always be discovered, documented, and solidified through the scientific process. Kuhnian paradigm shifts notwithstanding, scientific naturalism assumes the ever-progressing if incremental discovery of reality through scientific persistence.
"The second ontological system operation of our time, social relativism, descends from the humanistic and social scientific traditions. For the social relativist, nothing exists that cannot be explained through the machinations of human society--particularly the complex, evolutionary forms of culture and language. The social relativist argues that all things exist through conceptualization; they are really just structures within the temple of human cultural production. For the social relativist, the certainty of the scientific naturalist is always compromised by the fact that science itself is situated within culture--and not just culture writ large but some specific cultural moment, existing a particular time and in a particular place and making particular assumptions."

Rather crude, but serviceable insofar as straw people are built.

14:  "For the scientific naturalist, the world exists for human discovery and exploitation. And for the cultural relativist, humans create and refashion the world."

14:  Interesting point--the Turing Test assumes correlationism insofar as it assumes the sort of thought that machines might have is the human sort of thought.

15:  "a computer is to be considered useful the more it does *intelligent* things, that is, things that benefit human beings or things that human beings can recognize as intelligent activities."

16:  "A true posthumanism would neither extend humanity into a symbiotic, visionary future nor reject our place in the world via antihuman nihilism. 

Citing Levi Bryant, *Democracy of Objects*, 44.

17:  "a flat ontology of computation (or anything else) must be *specific* and *open-ended*, so as to make it less likely to fall into the trap of system operational overdetermination."

21-2:  Claims that it is easy to explain being. Indeed, the explanation "could be rendered via screen print on a trucker's cap." Says it is "tiny ontology." This idea is evidentially so simple that it is explained in four paragraphs (take that, Heidegger) and never actually defined or coherently discussed. A rather Morton-ian moment. "Tiny ontology" means something like a very dense, very small, one-dimensional point. That certainly clears things up. 

22-3:  Relates "tiny ontology" to Bryant's "mereology." Quoting Bryant, *Democracy of Objects*, 215: "one object is simultaneously a part of another object *and* an independent object in its own right."

23:  Term object is unhelpful. First, object and object-oriented have a specific meaning within computer programming and the use of these words introduces confusion. Second, object implies a correlate, subject. Object<=>Subject is correlationist. Third, object implies durable, material things. 

24:  The term thing (which I prefer to use) is also objectionable. Benefit: can be concrete or abstract. Detriment: tied up with Kantian thing-in-itself; Heidegger's view that things are created by humans; psychoanalyst call "lost objects" things. 

25:  "A thing is not just a thing for humans, but a thing for many other things as well, both material and immaterial."

25:  "Unit" is therefore preferable (even though it falls victim to the first criticism of "object"). 

25:  "Counterintuitively, a system and a unit represent three things at once: for one, a unit is isolated and unique. For another, a unit encloses a system---an entire universe's worth. For yet another, a unit becomes part of another system---often many other systems---as it jostles about."

25:  "These systems of units are held together tenuously by accidents. I have adapted the word *operation* to describe how units behave and interact. In systems theory, an operation is 'a basic process that takes one or more inputs and performs a transformation on it.'"

Quoting Ian Bogost, *Unit Operations*, 7.

30:  "*That* things are is not a matter of debate. *What it means that something in particular is for another thing that is*: this is the question that interests me. The significance of one thing to another differs depending on the perspectives of both."

31:  "Speculative realism names not only speculative philosophy that takes existence to be separate from thought but also a philosophy *claiming that things speculate* and, furthermore, one *that speculates about how things speculate*."

35-?:  Second chapter discusses the unfortunate cliche of object-oriented ontology: the list or, as Bogost prefers, "the Latour litany." It is annoying when Latour does it and it is even more annoying when Harman does it. Predictably, annoyance reaches its logical conclusion when Bogost spends pages and pages defending the sad practice (e.g., "turning the flowing legato of a literary account into the jarring staccato of real being").

50:  "The practice of ontography---and it is a practice, not merely a theory---describes the many processes of *accounting for* the various units that strew themselves throughout the universe. To create an ontograph involves cataloging things, but also drawing attention to the couplings of and chasms between them."
