Bogost, Ian. *Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing*. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2012.

Epigraph is from They May Might Be Giants--an ominous start.

8:  Citing Nash & Broglio introduction to *Configurations* issue on animal studies, Bogost states: "Once more, we find a focus on creatures from the vantage point of human intersubjectivity, rather than from the weird, murky mists of the really real."

8:  "We might also question animal studies' arbitrary specificity. Why trees and sea turtles instead of minerals or stem and leaf succulents? As Steven Shaviro has said in a passing criticism of the zoocentrism animal studies exhibits, 'What about plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, etc.?"

The answer to this seems rather obvious. Animal studies names "animals" as its object of studies. The word "studies" generally refers to something like the "sociology of [x] and humans." The criticism is odd: do they also criticize theoretical astrophysicists for not including lasagna in their analyses of black holes? This is stupid. Furthermore, I doubt anyone "in" animal studies would have many serious objections to studying, as Shaviro puts it, "plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, etc." Indeed, there are people who do so--i.e., "plant studies."

10:  "for the computer to operate at all *for us* first requires a wealth of interactions to take place *for itself*."

10:  vitalist/panpsychist approaches: "draws far too much attention to the similarities between humans and objects, rather than their differences."

11:  "In short, *all things equally exist, yet they do not exist equally*. The funeral pyre is not the same as the aardvark; the porcelleta shell is not equivalent to the rugby ball. Not only is neither pair reducible to human encounter, but also neither is reducible to the other."

It isn't clear how these two examples demonstrate the maxim. Part of the reason is that Bogost appears to be equivocating. In the first half of the maxim, "equally exist" refers to whether a thing exists or not. Hence, if it exists, then it exists. Full stop. In the second half of the maxim, the words "equally" and "exist" have taken on a new meaning. "Equal" is now taken to mean "in the same way." It is a moderately clever turn of phrase, but it is confused. Fortunately, in the next paragraph, Bogost comments "This maxim may seem like a tautology--or just a gag." If so, it's a bad one.

12:  A reiteration is more helpful: "things can *be* many and various, specific and concrete, while their *being* remains identical."

12-3:  "I've given the name *system operations* to the top-down organizing principles symbolized by ideas like 'the world' in Bryant's sense. System operations are 'totalizing structures that seek to explicate a phenomenon, behavior or state in its entirety.' They tend to assume that some final, holistic, definitive explanation accounts for and explains being."

Citing Ian Bogost, *Unit Operations*, 6. MIT Press, 2006.

13:  "In our current age, two such system operations are dominant: scientific naturalism and social relativism. The first descends from Democritus and Epicurus, if indirectly. The scientific naturalist holds that some fundamental material firmament sustains and thereby explains all that is. The particulars of this ground don't particularly matter--particle physics, genetics, brain chemistry, whatever. Never mind the *sort* of stuff, for the scientific naturalist there is always *some* stuff out of which all others can be explained. Furthermore, the nature of these fundamental objects and their role in founding the world can always be discovered, documented, and solidified through the scientific process. Kuhnian paradigm shifts notwithstanding, scientific naturalism assumes the ever-progressing if incremental discovery of reality through scientific persistence.
"The second ontological system operation of our time, social relativism, descends from the humanistic and social scientific traditions. For the social relativist, nothing exists that cannot be explained through the machinations of human society--particularly the complex, evolutionary forms of culture and language. The social relativist argues that all things exist through conceptualization; they are really just structures within the temple of human cultural production. For the social relativist, the certainty of the scientific naturalist is always compromised by the fact that science itself is situated within culture--and not just culture writ large but some specific cultural moment, existing a particular time and in a particular place and making particular assumptions."

Rather crude, but serviceable insofar as straw people are built.

14:  "For the scientific naturalist, the world exists for human discovery and exploitation. And for the cultural relativist, humans create and refashion the world."
