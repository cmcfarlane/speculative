Bogost, Ian. *Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing*. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2012.

Epigraph is from They May Might Be Giants--an ominous start.

8:  Citing Nash & Broglio introduction to *Configurations* issue on animal studies, Bogost states: "Once more, we find a focus on creatures from the vantage point of human intersubjectivity, rather than from the weird, murky mists of the really real."

8:  "We might also question animal studies' arbitrary specificity. Why trees and sea turtles instead of minerals or stem and leaf succulents? As Steven Shaviro has said in a passing criticism of the zoocentrism animal studies exhibits, 'What about plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, etc.?"

The answer to this seems rather obvious. Animal studies names "animals" as its object of studies. The word "studies" generally refers to something like the "sociology of [x] and humans." The criticism is odd: do they also criticize theoretical astrophysicists for not including lasagna in their analyses of black holes? This is stupid. Furthermore, I doubt anyone "in" animal studies would have many serious objections to studying, as Shaviro puts it, "plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, etc." Indeed, there are people who do so--i.e., "plant studies."

10:  "for the computer to operate at all *for us* first requires a wealth of interactions to take place *for itself*."

10:  vitalist/panpsychist approaches: "draws far too much attention to the similarities between humans and objects, rather than their differences."

11:  "In short, *all things equally exist, yet they do not exist equally*. The funeral pyre is not the same as the aardvark; the porcelleta shell is not equivalent to the rugby ball. Not only is neither pair reducible to human encounter, but also neither is reducible to the other."

It isn't clear how these two examples demonstrate the maxim. Part of the reason is that Bogost appears to be equivocating. In the first half of the maxim, "equally exist" refers to whether a thing exists or not. Hence, if it exists, then it exists. Full stop. In the second half of the maxim, the words "equally" and "exist" have taken on a new meaning. "Equal" is now taken to mean "in the same way." It is a moderately clever turn of phrase, but it is confused. Fortunately, in the next paragraph, Bogost comments "This maxim may seem like a tautology--or just a gag." If so, it's a bad one.

12:  A reiteration is more helpful: "things can *be* many and various, specific and concrete, while their *being* remains identical."

12-3:  "I've given the name *system operations* to the top-down organizing principles symbolized by ideas like 'the world' in Bryant's sense. System operations are 'totalizing structures that seek to explicate a phenomenon, behavior or state in its entirety.' They tend to assume that some final, holistic, definitive explanation accounts for and explains being."

Citing Ian Bogost, *Unit Operations*, 6. MIT Press, 2006.

13:  "In our current age, two such system operations are dominant: scientific naturalism and social relativism. The first descends from Democritus and Epicurus, if indirectly. The scientific naturalist holds that some fundamental material firmament sustains and thereby explains all that is. The particulars of this ground don't particularly matter--particle physics, genetics, brain chemistry, whatever. Never mind the *sort* of stuff, for the scientific naturalist there is always *some* stuff out of which all others can be explained. Furthermore, the nature of these fundamental objects and their role in founding the world can always be discovered, documented, and solidified through the scientific process. Kuhnian paradigm shifts notwithstanding, scientific naturalism assumes the ever-progressing if incremental discovery of reality through scientific persistence.
"The second ontological system operation of our time, social relativism, descends from the humanistic and social scientific traditions. For the social relativist, nothing exists that cannot be explained through the machinations of human society--particularly the complex, evolutionary forms of culture and language. The social relativist argues that all things exist through conceptualization; they are really just structures within the temple of human cultural production. For the social relativist, the certainty of the scientific naturalist is always compromised by the fact that science itself is situated within culture--and not just culture writ large but some specific cultural moment, existing a particular time and in a particular place and making particular assumptions."

Rather crude, but serviceable insofar as straw people are built.

14:  "For the scientific naturalist, the world exists for human discovery and exploitation. And for the cultural relativist, humans create and refashion the world."

14:  Interesting point--the Turing Test assumes correlationism insofar as it assumes the sort of thought that machines might have is the human sort of thought.

15:  "a computer is to be considered useful the more it does *intelligent* things, that is, things that benefit human beings or things that human beings can recognize as intelligent activities."

16:  "A true posthumanism would neither extend humanity into a symbiotic, visionary future nor reject our place in the world via antihuman nihilism. 

Citing Levi Bryant, *Democracy of Objects*, 44.

17:  "a flat ontology of computation (or anything else) must be *specific* and *open-ended*, so as to make it less likely to fall into the trap of system operational overdetermination."

21-2:  Claims that it is easy to explain being. Indeed, the explanation "could be rendered via screen print on a trucker's cap." Says it is "tiny ontology." This idea is evidentially so simple that it is explained in four paragraphs (take that, Heidegger) and never actually defined or coherently discussed. A rather Morton-ian moment. "Tiny ontology" means something like a very dense, very small, one-dimensional point. That certainly clears things up. 

22-3:  Relates "tiny ontology" to Bryant's "mereology." Quoting Bryant, *Democracy of Objects*, 215: "one object is simultaneously a part of another object *and* an independent object in its own right."

23:  Term object is unhelpful. First, object and object-oriented have a specific meaning within computer programming and the use of these words introduces confusion. Second, object implies a correlate, subject. Object<=>Subject is correlationist. Third, object implies durable, material things. 

24:  The term thing (which I prefer to use) is also objectionable. Benefit: can be concrete or abstract. Detriment: tied up with Kantian thing-in-itself; Heidegger's view that things are created by humans; psychoanalyst call "lost objects" things. 

25:  "A thing is not just a thing for humans, but a thing for many other things as well, both material and immaterial."

25:  "Unit" is therefore preferable (even though it falls victim to the first criticism of "object"). 

25:  "Counterintuitively, a system and a unit represent three things at once: for one, a unit is isolated and unique. For another, a unit encloses a system---an entire universe's worth. For yet another, a unit becomes part of another system---often many other systems---as it jostles about."

25:  "These systems of units are held together tenuously by accidents. I have adapted the word *operation* to describe how units behave and interact. In systems theory, an operation is 'a basic process that takes one or more inputs and performs a transformation on it.'"

Quoting Ian Bogost, *Unit Operations*, 7.

30:  "*That* things are is not a matter of debate. *What it means that something in particular is for another thing that is*: this is the question that interests me. The significance of one thing to another differs depending on the perspectives of both."

31:  "Speculative realism names not only speculative philosophy that takes existence to be separate from thought but also a philosophy *claiming that things speculate* and, furthermore, one *that speculates about how things speculate*."

35-?:  Second chapter discusses the unfortunate cliche of object-oriented ontology: the list or, as Bogost prefers, "the Latour litany." It is annoying when Latour does it and it is even more annoying when Harman does it. Predictably, annoyance reaches its logical conclusion when Bogost spends pages and pages defending the sad practice (e.g., "turning the flowing legato of a literary account into the jarring staccato of real being"). It'd be nice if the speculative realists would just "do philosophy" and stop trying to "be literary" (Harman is the greatest criminal in this regard).

50:  "The practice of ontography---and it is a practice, not merely a theory---describes the many processes of *accounting for* the various units that strew themselves throughout the universe. To create an ontograph involves cataloging things, but also drawing attention to the couplings of and chasms between them."

61:  "But for the hookah, the gear, or the chicken [in soup pot], what's going on?"

The chicken is dead, dude.

62:  Only now we get a reference to Nagel's "What is it like to be a bat?" Surprised it took so long!

62:  Compares Harman's "withdrawal" to Nagel's "the subjective character of experience." Likely the clearest explanation of Harman's concept. "Because of this elusiveness (which OOO calls *withdrawal*), physical reductionism can never explain the experience of a being."

63:  "But to understand how something operates on its surroundings, or they on it, is not the same as understanding how that other thing *understands* those operations."

Earlier, panpsychism (and, presumably Spinozan panetheism) had been ruled out. We can speak of "understanding" vis a vis things that have something resembling a mind. That is, things that are capable of thought (regardless of how rudimentary). Thus, animals. The argument about "withdrawal" makes sense here: how a bat understands itself is different than how a human understands how a bat understands itself. But Bogost wants to talk about (it seems) how a book understands itself or how a rock understands itself or how a unicorn understands itself. 

64:  "Unlike objective phenomenology [e.g., Nagel], alien phenomenology accepts that the subjective character of experiences cannot be fully recuperated objectively, even if it remains wholly real. In a literal sense, *the only way to perform alien phenomenology is by analogy*."

64-5:  "The risk of falling into anthropocentrism is strong. Indeed, I'll take things farther: anthropocentrism is unavoidable, at least for us humans. The same is true of any unit (for the bats, chiropteracentrism is the problem). The subjective nature of experience makes the unit operation of one of its perceptions amount always to a caricature in which the one is drawn in the distorted impression of the other. This is true not only of the encounter itself but also of any account of the encounter, which only further distances the one from the other by virtue of the introduction of additional layers of mediation."

Generally speaking, Bogost is correct. A particular being cannot escape its bounded "subjective experience" and, thus, their experience is always subjectively bound. Humans can imagine what is like for humans to imagine being bats---awkwardly expressed, but true. A human cannot actually experience bat-ness; only an analogy of it---what it would be like *for a human* to be a bat.

The problem Bogost does not identify is that not all anthropocentrisms are equal. Anthropocentrism, normally conceived, is the idea that there is a necessary connection between ontology and politics such that humans are at the centre of all things and, thus, there politics should be organized accordingly. That the world exists *for* humans and that it is up to humans to organize the world as they see fit given their centrality. Flat ontology has to reject this sense of anthropocentrism, which is the most common.

Without specifying the problem, Bogost is confusing the onto-political sense of anthropocentrism (the usual one) with an epistemological sense of anthropocentrism (how he's using the word). What is at issue for Bogost is the ability of particular things to generalize their perspective (their "subjective experience") in relation to other things. His sense of anthropocentrism asks the question, "Can humans *know* what it is like to be a bat?" The standard sense of anthropocentrism asks the absurd question, "Can humans *be* a bat?" And, of course, dismisses the question as not only absurd but also insulting to humans who are at the centre of things.

Now, it is true the ontological and the epistemological are connected. What a thing is determines what a thing can experience. But the "unavoidable anthropocentrism" defended by Bogost only enters at the second level; not the first.

65:  "There is considerable difference between accepting the truth of human accounts of object perceptions and recognizing that, as humans, we are destined to offer anthropomorphic metaphors for the unit operations of object perception, particularly when our intention frequently involves communicating those accounts to other humans."

Quoting Jane Bennett, *Vibrant Matter*, 120: "Maybe it's worth running the risks associated with anthropomorphizing (superstition, the divinization of nature, romanticism) because it, only oddly, works against anthropocentrism: a chord is struck between person and thing, and I am no longer above or outside a nonhuman 'environment.'"

Frans de Waal makes a similar argument the anthropomorphization of primates. Not mentioned by Bogost.

66:  "Objects try to make sense of each other through the qualities and logics they possess. When one object caricatures another, the first grasps the second in abstract, enough for the one to make some sense of the other given its own internal properties. A caricature is a rendering that captures some aspects of something else at the cost of other aspects."

67:  "If we take seriously Harman's suggestion that relation takes place not just *like* metaphor but *as* metaphor, then an opportunity suggests itself: what if we deployed *metaphor itself* as a way to grasp alien objects' perceptions of one another. [...] Metaphorism offers a method for alien phenomenology to grasp at the ways objects bask metaphorically in each others' "notes" (Harman's name, following Xavier Zubíri for the attributes of a real object) by *means of metaphor itself*, rather than by describing the effects of such interactions on the objects."
