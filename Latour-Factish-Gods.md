Preface
---

ix:  "Either you have to destroy all the things you have created in order to remain cool as a rational being, or else you will be taken in by the creatures of your own hands: as if there were no plausible passage between fetishism and iconoclasm."

ix:  ""On the one hand, it tells us that we have to choose between fiery illusions and icy reasons, but on the other, it tells us the opposite, since there is no way to choose between the two, as soon as we put our hand into the creation of any thing."

x:  "If the notion of *factish* allows one to suspend the belief of belief, that of *iconoclash* aims at suspending iconoclastic gestures."

Chapter 1: On the Cult of the Factish Gods

	Largely gives the impression of being a condensed and updated version of *We Have Never Been Modern*.

2:  "*agnosticism* as a way of ceasing to believe in belief."

10:  "Once idolatry's reversal has been reversed, once the projection of power has been 'projected' back into an overhead, it is not the 'I,' the working individual, who is found at the end of the road, but a group, a multitude, a collective. Under the now-dispelled fantasy of the fetish, the enlightened human being realizes that his not really alone, but that he shares his existence with a crowd of actors. The alien he thought he was eliminating comes back in the frightfully complicated form of a social multitude. The human actor has merely exchanged one form of transcendence for another."

11:  "*the fetish-less world is populated by as many aliens as the world of the fetish*."

12:  "When they denounce the naive belief of actors in fetishes, they are using human action that is free and focused on the subject. But when they denounce the naive belief of actors in their own subjective freedom, the critical thinkers are using objects--as they are known by the objective sciences--that they have established, and in which they place their full trust. They thus alternate between fairy-objects and fact-objects, so they can show off to ordinary, naive people twice."

16:  "Either he has socially constructed his facts out of whole cloth (and thus he is adding no reality to the world's repertoire other than that of his fantasies, prejudices, habits, or memories), or else the facts are real (but then he did not construct them out of whole cloth in his laboratory)."

17:  "constructivism and realism are synonymous terms."

22:  "*factish* for the robust certainty that allows practices to pass into action without the practitioner ever believing in the difference between construction and reality, immanence and transcendence."

24:  "We shall now use the word 'belief' for the process that allows one to keep an official theory at the farthest possible distance from its informal practice, without any relationship between the two except for the passionate, anxious, and meticulous care taken to maintain the separation, and we shall the anthropological description of that process 'agnoticism.'"

33:  "If I am putting amulet-covered Portugese on the same level as amulet-covered Guineans, fetishists on the same level as anti-fetishists, saligram worshippers on the same level as iconoclastic Brahmins, I am not dragging them all down, *I am pulling them all up*."
