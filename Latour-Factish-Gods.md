Preface
---

ix:  "Either you have to destroy all the things you have created in order to remain cool as a rational being, or else you will be taken in by the creatures of your own hands: as if there were no plausible passage between fetishism and iconoclasm."

ix:  ""On the one hand, it tells us that we have to choose between fiery illusions and icy reasons, but on the other, it tells us the opposite, since there is no way to choose between the two, as soon as we put our hand into the creation of any thing."

x:  "If the notion of *factish* allows one to suspend the belief of belief, that of *iconoclash* aims at suspending iconoclastic gestures."

Chapter 1: On the Cult of the Factish Gods
---

	Largely gives the impression of being a condensed and updated version of *We Have Never Been Modern*.

2:  "*agnosticism* as a way of ceasing to believe in belief."

10:  "Once idolatry's reversal has been reversed, once the projection of power has been 'projected' back into an overhead, it is not the 'I,' the working individual, who is found at the end of the road, but a group, a multitude, a collective. Under the now-dispelled fantasy of the fetish, the enlightened human being realizes that his not really alone, but that he shares his existence with a crowd of actors. The alien he thought he was eliminating comes back in the frightfully complicated form of a social multitude. The human actor has merely exchanged one form of transcendence for another."

11:  "*the fetish-less world is populated by as many aliens as the world of the fetish*."

12:  "When they denounce the naive belief of actors in fetishes, they are using human action that is free and focused on the subject. But when they denounce the naive belief of actors in their own subjective freedom, the critical thinkers are using objects--as they are known by the objective sciences--that they have established, and in which they place their full trust. They thus alternate between fairy-objects and fact-objects, so they can show off to ordinary, naive people twice."

16:  "Either he has socially constructed his facts out of whole cloth (and thus he is adding no reality to the world's repertoire other than that of his fantasies, prejudices, habits, or memories), or else the facts are real (but then he did not construct them out of whole cloth in his laboratory)."

17:  "constructivism and realism are synonymous terms."

22:  "*factish* for the robust certainty that allows practices to pass into action without the practitioner ever believing in the difference between construction and reality, immanence and transcendence."

24:  "We shall now use the word 'belief' for the process that allows one to keep an official theory at the farthest possible distance from its informal practice, without any relationship between the two except for the passionate, anxious, and meticulous care taken to maintain the separation, and we shall the anthropological description of that process 'agnoticism.'"

33:  "If I am putting amulet-covered Portugese on the same level as amulet-covered Guineans, fetishists on the same level as anti-fetishists, saligram worshippers on the same level as iconoclastic Brahmins, I am not dragging them all down, *I am pulling them all up*."

35:  In line with criticism of factish/fetish vis a vis objects, it is neither to do the same work vis a vis subjects: "the subject understood as the source of action must change as much as the target-object."

40:  "It is clear that the subject endowed with interiority serves as counterweight to objects endowed with exteriority. In order to link them, we have to invent the notion of representation. Thanks to this notion, the subject endowed with interiority begins to project its own codes onto 'external reality,' codes that supposedly come to it, via a most impressive causal chain, from linguistic structures, from the subconscious, from the brain, from history, from society. This time the confusion is complete. A subject that is the source of action, endowed with interiority and consciousness, arbitrarily carves out an external reality that exists independently from it and determines, through some other channel, those same representations."

50:  "Instead of comparing theories, let us compare practices..."

51:  "When we lose the distinction between representations and facts, we by no means plunge into indifferentiation."

52:  "They [fears] pass, they cross, they bounce over it; if they touch it, they do so by mistake, almost inadvertently; if they possess it, this is because they have mistaken their target. A series of lawless substitutions, they can transmute any being into any other being at any time. And that is why they elicit terror, and with good reason."

52:  "*transfears*"

53:  "the invisibility of these fears does not result from a lack of existence."

53:  "Charms, like angels, are very poor messengers."

58:  "We can substitute one attachment with another, but we cannot move from a state of attachment to that of detachment. [...] To understand the activity of subjects, their emotions, their passions, we must turn our attention to that which attaches and activates them--an obvious proposition but one normally overlooked."

60:  "If we define politics as the progressive constitution of a common world, we can easily see how difficult it is to imagine a collective existence, if all those who wished to participate were first asked to leave behind, in the outside vestibule, all the appurtenances and attachments which enabled them to exist."

64:  "Social constructivism is the poor man's creationism."

Chapter 2: What is *Iconoclash*? Or is There a World Beyond the Image Wars?
---

69:  "What has occurred to make images (and by image we mean any sign, work of art, inscription, or picture that acts as a mediation to access something else) the focus of so much passion? To the point that destroying them, erasing them, defacing them, has been taken as the ultimate touchstone, proving the validity of one's faith, one's science, one's critical acumen, and one's artistic creativity? To the point where being an iconoclast seems the highest virtue, the highest piety, in intellectual circles?"

71:  "I treat as iconoclasts those who speak of the humans at work--scientists in their laboratories--behind or beneath the images that generate scientific objectivity. I have also been held by this paradoxical *iconoclash*: the new reverence for the images of science is taken to be their destruction. The only way to defend science against the accusation of fabrication, to avoid the label of 'socially constructed,' is apparently to insist that no human hand has ever touched the image it has produced."

72:  "we can define an *iconoclash* as that which happens when there is uncertainty about the exact role of the hand at work in the production of a mediator."

73:  Three sources of iconoclashes: religion, science and contemporary art.

73:  "religious images are still the ones that attract the fiercest passions."

73:  "idol smashing is in no way limited to religious minds."

74-5:  "it slowly becomes clearer that without huge and costly instruments, large groups of scientists, vast amounts of money, and long training, nothing would be visible in such images. It is because of so many mediations that they are able to be so objectively true."

75:  "the more instruments, the more mediation, the  better the grasp of reality."

75:  "the more human-made images are generated, the more objectivity will be collected. In science, there is no such thing as mere representation."

75-6:  "Everyone and every detail of what art is and what an icon is--an idol, a sight, a gaze--has been thrown into the pot to be cooked and burnt up in the past century of what used to be called modernist art. A Last Judgment has been passed: all our ways of producing representations of any sort have been found wanting."

76:  "different patterns of image rejection and image construction, of image confidence and image diffidence."

78:  "is this made by your own hands, in which case it is worthless; or is this objective, true, transcendent, in which case you cannot possibly have made it? Either God is doing everything and humans are doing nothing, or the humans are doing all the work and God is nothing: too much or too little when the fetishes are gone."

83-4:  "Type A is thus the pure form of iconoclasm, recognizable in the formalist's rejection of imagination, drawing and models, as well as in the many Byzantine, Lutheran, revolutionary movements of idol smashers, and in the horrifying 'excesses' of the Cultural Revolution. Purification is their goal. The world, for A people, would be a much better place, much cleaner, much more enlightened, if only one could get ride of all mediations: if one could jump directly into contact with the original, the ideas, the true God."

84:  "One of the problems with the As is that they have to believe that the others--the poor guys whose cherished icons have been accused of being impious idols--believe naively in them."

84:  "But the deepest problem of the As is that no one knows whether they are not Bs!"

84:  "The difference between the As and the Bs is that the latter do not believe it is possible nor necessary to get rid of images. What they fight is freeze-framing, that is, extracting an image out of the flow, becoming fascinated by it, as if it where sufficient, as if all movement had stopped."

85:  "For them, the only way to access truth, objectivity, and sanctity is to move fast from one image to another, not to dream the impossible dream of jumping to a non-existing original."

85:  "The damage done to icons is, to them, always a charitable injunction to redirect their attention towards other, newer, fresher, more sacred images: not to do without image."

86:  "As and Bs could, after all, simply be Cs in disguise."

86:  "contrary to the As and to the Bs, they [Cs] have nothing against images in general: they are only against the image to which their opponents cling most forcefully."

86:  "Tell me what you hold to be most dear and I will wreck it so as to kill you faster."

87:  "The search for the suitable object to attract destruction and hatred is reciprocal: 'Before you wanted to attack my flag, I did not know I cherished it so much, but now I do.' So the provocateurs and those they provoke are playing cat and mouse, the first looking for what triggers indignation faster, the others looking eagerly for what will trigger indignation most fiercely."

87-8:  "There is another kind of icon smasher [Ds], a most devious case, those who could be called the 'innocent vandals.' As is well known, vandalism is a term of spite invented to describe those who destroy not so much out of a hatred of images, but out of ignorance, a lust for profit, and sheer passion and lunacy."

88:  "But the innocent vandals are different from the normal, 'bad' vandals: they had absolutely no idea that they were destroying anything. On the contrary, they were cherishing images and protecting them from destruction, and yet they are accused later of having profaned and destroyed them."

89:  "To be complete, one should add the Es, who doubt the idol breakers as much as the icon worshippers. They are diffident to any sharp distinction between the two poles; they exercise their devastating irony against all mediators: not that they want to get rid of them, but because they are so conscious of their fragility."

Chapter 3: "Thou Shalt Not Free Frame," Or How Not to Misunderstand the Science and Religion Debate
---

100:  "Truth production in science, religion, law, politics, technology, economics, etc. is what I have been studying, over the years, in my program to advance toward an anthropology of the modern (or rather non-modern) world."

101:  "What I am going to argue is that religion--again in the tradition which is mine--does not speak *of* things, but *from* things--entities, agencies, situations, substances, relations, experiences, whatever is the word--which are highly sensitive to the *ways* in which they are talked about."

106:  "to disappoint the drive towards double-click--to divert it, to break it, to subvert it, to render it impossible--is just what religious talk is after."

106:  "Transport of information, without deformation, is not one of religious talk's conditions of felicity."

111:  "Science in action, science as it is done practically, is even further from double-click communication than religion. Distortion; transformation; recoding; modeling; translating: each of these radical mediations is necessary to produce reliable and accurate information. If science were information *without* transformation, as good commons sense would like to have it, we would still be in complete obscurity about states of affairs distant from the here and now. Double-click communication does even less justice to the transformation of information in scientific networks than it does to the strange ability of some speech-acts to transform the interlocutors in religion."

114:  "rats, those unsung heroes of biology."

121-2:  "*belief is a caricature of religion exactly as knowledge is a caricature of science*. Belief is patterned after a false idea of science, as if it were possible to raise the question 'Do you believe in God?' in the same way as 'Do you believe in global warming?' except the first question does not possess any of the instruments that would allow the reference to move on, and that the second is leading the interlocutor to a phenomenon even more invisible to the naked eye than GOd, since to reach it we have to travel through satellite imaging, computer simulation, theories of earth atmospheric instability, or high stratosphere chemistry. Belief is not a quasi-knowledge question *plus* a leap of faith to reach even *further* away; knowledge is not a quasi-belief question that would be answerable by looking directly at things close to hand."

122:  "Belief is simply immaterial for any religious speech-act; knowledge is not an accurate way to characterize scientific activity."
