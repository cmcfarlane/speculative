Preface
---

ix:  "Either you have to destroy all the things you have created in order to remain cool as a rational being, or else you will be taken in by the creatures of your own hands: as if there were no plausible passage between fetishism and iconoclasm."

ix:  ""On the one hand, it tells us that we have to choose between fiery illusions and icy reasons, but on the other, it tells us the opposite, since there is no way to choose between the two, as soon as we put our hand into the creation of any thing."

x:  "If the notion of *factish* allows one to suspend the belief of belief, that of *iconoclash* aims at suspending iconoclastic gestures."

Chapter 1: On the Cult of the Factish Gods
---

	Largely gives the impression of being a condensed and updated version of *We Have Never Been Modern*.

2:  "*agnosticism* as a way of ceasing to believe in belief."

10:  "Once idolatry's reversal has been reversed, once the projection of power has been 'projected' back into an overhead, it is not the 'I,' the working individual, who is found at the end of the road, but a group, a multitude, a collective. Under the now-dispelled fantasy of the fetish, the enlightened human being realizes that his not really alone, but that he shares his existence with a crowd of actors. The alien he thought he was eliminating comes back in the frightfully complicated form of a social multitude. The human actor has merely exchanged one form of transcendence for another."

11:  "*the fetish-less world is populated by as many aliens as the world of the fetish*."

12:  "When they denounce the naive belief of actors in fetishes, they are using human action that is free and focused on the subject. But when they denounce the naive belief of actors in their own subjective freedom, the critical thinkers are using objects--as they are known by the objective sciences--that they have established, and in which they place their full trust. They thus alternate between fairy-objects and fact-objects, so they can show off to ordinary, naive people twice."

16:  "Either he has socially constructed his facts out of whole cloth (and thus he is adding no reality to the world's repertoire other than that of his fantasies, prejudices, habits, or memories), or else the facts are real (but then he did not construct them out of whole cloth in his laboratory)."

17:  "constructivism and realism are synonymous terms."

22:  "*factish* for the robust certainty that allows practices to pass into action without the practitioner ever believing in the difference between construction and reality, immanence and transcendence."

24:  "We shall now use the word 'belief' for the process that allows one to keep an official theory at the farthest possible distance from its informal practice, without any relationship between the two except for the passionate, anxious, and meticulous care taken to maintain the separation, and we shall the anthropological description of that process 'agnoticism.'"

33:  "If I am putting amulet-covered Portugese on the same level as amulet-covered Guineans, fetishists on the same level as anti-fetishists, saligram worshippers on the same level as iconoclastic Brahmins, I am not dragging them all down, *I am pulling them all up*."

35:  In line with criticism of factish/fetish vis a vis objects, it is neither to do the same work vis a vis subjects: "the subject understood as the source of action must change as much as the target-object."

40:  "It is clear that the subject endowed with interiority serves as counterweight to objects endowed with exteriority. In order to link them, we have to invent the notion of representation. Thanks to this notion, the subject endowed with interiority begins to project its own codes onto 'external reality,' codes that supposedly come to it, via a most impressive causal chain, from linguistic structures, from the subconscious, from the brain, from history, from society. This time the confusion is complete. A subject that is the source of action, endowed with interiority and consciousness, arbitrarily carves out an external reality that exists independently from it and determines, through some other channel, those same representations."

50:  "Instead of comparing theories, let us compare practices..."

51:  "When we lose the distinction between representations and facts, we by no means plunge into indifferentiation."

52:  "They [fears] pass, they cross, they bounce over it; if they touch it, they do so by mistake, almost inadvertently; if they possess it, this is because they have mistaken their target. A series of lawless substitutions, they can transmute any being into any other being at any time. And that is why they elicit terror, and with good reason."

52:  "*transfears*"

53:  "the invisibility of these fears does not result from a lack of existence."

53:  "Charms, like angels, are very poor messengers."

58:  "We can substitute one attachment with another, but we cannot move from a state of attachment to that of detachment. [...] To understand the activity of subjects, their emotions, their passions, we must turn our attention to that which attaches and activates them--an obvious proposition but one normally overlooked."

60:  "If we define politics as the progressive constitution of a common world, we can easily see how difficult it is to imagine a collective existence, if all those who wished to participate were first asked to leave behind, in the outside vestibule, all the appurtenances and attachments which enabled them to exist."

64:  "Social constructivism is the poor man's creationism."
