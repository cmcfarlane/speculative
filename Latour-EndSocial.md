118:  "the nature/society divide is irrelevant for understanding the world of human interactions"

118:  "the micro/macro distinction stifles any attempt at understanding how society is generated"

119:  "monads are also completely materialist: they are guided by no superior goal, no grand design, no *telos*. Each of them, much like Richard Dawkins' genes or Susan Blackmore's memes, fights for its own privately envisioned goal."

119:  "the smallest entities are always richer in difference and complexity than their aggregates or than the superficial appearances that we observe from a distance."

119:  "Agency plus influence and imitation is exactly what has been called, albeit with different words, an actor-network."

120:  "we have to understand that 'society' is a word that can be attributed to *any* association"

120: "Instead of saying, like Durkheim, that we 'should treat social facts as a thing', Tarde says 'all things are society', and any phenomenon is a social fact."

121:  "To make sense of it, we have to add the other feature that sets human society apart, one which appears even queerer at first: those assemblages are not only seen from the inside, they are almost made of very few elements, compared to all other societies. A polyp, a brain, a stone, a gas, a star, are made of much vaster collections of monads than are human societies."

122:  "The big, the whole, the great, is not superior to the monad, it is only a simpler, more standardized version of *one of the monad's goals which it has reached in making part of its view shared by others*."

127:  "whenever you want to understand a network, go and look for the actors, but when you want to understand an actor, go and look through the net at the work it has traced."

128:  "the agencies to deal with, the ones we really have to consider if we wish to explain something, are neither human agents nor social structures, but the monads themselves in their efforts to constitute unstable aggregates, what we would call actants or world-building *entelechies*."
