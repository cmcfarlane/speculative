1:  "nothing sensible--whether it be an affective or perceptual quality--can exist in the way it is given to me in the thing itself, when it is not related to me or to any other living creature. When one thinks about this thing 'in itself', i.e., independently of its relation to me, it seems that none of these qualities can subsist. Remove the observer, and the world becomes devoid of these sonorous, visual, olfactory, etc., qualities, just as the flame becomes devoid of pain once the finger is removed."

2:  "Whether it be affective or perceptual, the sensible only exists as a *relation*: a relation between the world and the living creature I am."

2:  "the sensible *is* a relation, rather than a property inherent in the thing."

3:  "*all those aspects of the object that can be formulated in mathematical terms can be meaningfully conceived as properties of the object in itself*."

5:  "the central notion of modern philosophy since Kant seems to be that of *correlation*. By 'correlation' we mean the idea that according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other."

6:  Correlationist circle: "we never grasp an object 'in itself', in isolation from its relation to the subject, but it also becomes necessary to maintain that we can never grasp a subject that would not always-already be related to an object."

object=>subject=>object=>subject=>...

6:  Correlationist two-step: "the primacy of the relation over the related terms; a belief in the constitutive power of reciprocal relation."

10:  Ancestral: "any reality anterior to the emergence of the human species--even anterior to every recognized form of life on earth."

10:  Arche-fossil/fossil-matter: "materials indicating the existence of an ancestral reality or event; one that is anterior to terrestrial life."

26:  "how is mathematical discourse able to describe a world where humanity is absent; a world crammed with things and events that are not the correlates of any manifestation; a world that is not the correlate of a relation to the world?"
