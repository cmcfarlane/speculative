66:  "*Ustopia* is a word I made up by combining utopia and dystopia--the imagined perfect society and its opposite--because, in my view, each contains a latent version of the other."

67:  "From our earliest days, as soon as we can crawl around ont he floor, we are inscribing maps of our surroundings onto the neural pathways in our brains and--reciprocally--inscribing our own tracks, markings, and namings and claimings onto the landscape itself."

68:  "heroes need monsters in order to establish their heroic credentials through combat, but monsters most emphatically do not need heroes."

71:  "As ustopia is by definition elsewhere, it is almost always bracketed by two journeys: the one that transports the tale-teller to the other place and the one that transports him (or her) back so he can deliver his report to us."

73:  "But any writer of ustopias has to answer three necessary questions: where is it, when is it, and--in relation to maps--what shape is it?"

83:  "the brave new order often comes about as the result of war and chaos."

84:  "Why is that when we grab for heaven--socialist or capitalist or even religious--we so often produce hell? I'm not sure, but so it is. Maybe it's the lumpiness of human beings. What do you do with people who somehow just don't or wont' fit into your scheme?"

85:  "within each utopia, a concealed dystopia; within each dystopia, a hidden utopia, if only in the form of the world as it existed before the bad guys took over."

90:  "Of recent years, American society has moved much closer to the conditions necessary for a takeover of its own power structures by an anti-democratic and repressive government."

91:  "I suppose that's what happens to ustopian societies when they die: they don't go to Heaven, they become thesis topics."
