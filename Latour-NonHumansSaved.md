460:  "no anthropology of the modern can be carried out without taking religion seriously."

460:  "What I mean by taking religion 'seriously' is to take it *religiously*."

461:  "The precise truth conditions (or felicity conditions) that allow someone to speak religiously (and not 'about' religion in another tone of voice) have almost vanished (the same is true, by the way, of political enunciation)."

464:  "Yet perhaps we can postpone this seemingly inevitable Apocalypse: religion could become a powerful alternative to modernizing and a powerful help for ecologizing, provided that a connection can be established (or rather re-established) between religion *and Creation* instead of religion *and nature*."

466:  "what is called 'nature' ... is made of at least two entirely different layers of meaning: one consists of the ways in which reference chains need to be arrayed so as to work, by giving us knowledge of far-away entities and processes of all kinds; but the other is provided by a completely different type of mode, and that is the ways in which he entities themselves manage to remain in existence. Having called the first Reference, I will call this second *Reproduction*."

466:  "these two *modes of existence*"

466:  "To reach something far away through long arrays of instruments, you need to make sure that necessities and constants are transported with as little transformation as possible (this is why I call them *immutable mobiles*). But that such a path is necessary to *reach* those entities which could not be grasped otherwise does not mean that those entities use the same subterfuges to remain in existence, to persist and endure."

468:  "It is not clear, but once we are out of nature we have to realize that we all reside in some *Umwelt*. (The only thinker who has absorbed this new situation is of course the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, with his theory of Spheres--a radically original alternative to nature and to society.)"

472:  "one commits an immense injustice by confusing the 'material world' with nature."

472:  "abandoning the awkwardly makeshift concepts of matter and nature doe snot mean that you abandon science and objectivity."

473:  "can we respect Religion, at least, once we respect the proper transcendences of Reproduction and Reference?"
