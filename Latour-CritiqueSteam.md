Latour, Bruno. "What Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern." *Critical Inquiry* 30 (2004): 225-48.

231:  "The question was never to get *away* from facts but *closer* to them, not fighting empiricism but, on the contrary, renewing empiricism."

231:  "the critical mind, if it is to renew itself and be relevant again, is to be found in the cultivation of a *stubbornly realist attitude* ... but a realism dealing with what I will call *matters of concern*, not *matters of fact*."

232:  "Matters of fact are not all that is given in experience. Matters of fact are only very partial and, I would argue, very polemical, very political renderings of matters of concern and only a subset of what could also be called *states of affairs*."

233:  "A thing is, in one sense, an object out there and, in another sense, an *issue* very much *in* there, at any rate, a *gathering*. To use the term I introduced earlier now more precisely, the same word *thing* designates matters of fact and matters of concern."
